# Background
## From PRO to ePRO
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires measure a patient's perception of the impact of a disease and its treatment[^khadka_importance_2012]. PRO information enhances patient-centred care generally, but is particularly useful in oncology where side-effects from treatment are common[^lipscomb_patient-reported_2007].

Initially PROs were almost exclusively collected in research[^brundage_patterns_2011] using a classic pen and paper approach, however the advent of electronic PRO (ePRO) systems based on tablet or web technologies has allowed their use in routine oncological practice[^basch_supporting_2011], in palliative care[^antunes_implementing_2013] and during cancer survivorship[^ashley_feasibility_2011].
