# PROsaiq online demonstrator

This public demonstrator aims at providing an easy introduction into the functionality and opportunities of the PROsaiq system. For details about the PROsaiq project including scientific background and technical details please refer to the open access JROI article: [coming soon...](http://jroi.org).

The following diagram provides an overview of the PROsaiq prototype components:
![PROsaiq prototype demonstrator overview](images/prosaiq-demo.png)
PROsaiq system integrates existing (**blue**) and new (**yellow**) components in order to deliver new functionality efficiently and can be described as an ["enterprise mashup"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_mashups).  

The components marked with the **red star** can be accessed as part of this demonstrator. In a live PROsaiq environment the __HL7 Converter and [Formhub](https://formhub.org/) Webserver run in the background (i.e. no direct user interaction)__ providing MOSAIQ with HL7 files for automatic importation. As there is no online MOSAIQ system that could have been used for this demonstrator, a simple web-based user interface was built to display the HL7 message generated from the data received by the 'HL7 converter' component.

## Try it out

### I. Data collection via a web browser

PROsaiq uses [Enketo](https://enketo.org/) for browser-based data collection. This enables PROsaiq to be used on multiple devices such as tablet computer, smart phone, personal computer provided they support a modern browser with adequate HTML5 support. Note that if you are having issues using this demonstrator, please try accessing from a Chrome, Firefox or Safari browser.

This demonstrator has three examples:  

* Follow the links in the first column of the table to open an online form  
  * repeat the following steps for each form
* Fill in the form and press 'Submit'
  * a message will be appear to say that the request has been queued and then submitted  
* Return to this page and continue with [II.](#ViewHL7)

ePRO Instrument | Comment

<a href="https://qxrqf.enketo.formhub.org/webform" target="_blank">Patient Reported Functional Status (PRFS)</a>| The Patient Reported Functional Status (PRFS) is a [ECOG status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECOG_score) assessment expressed in lay language. It has bee developed and validated by Cancer Care Ontario (for details see [here](https://www.cancercare.on.ca/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=277285)).
<a href="https://tdr54.enketo.formhub.org/webform" target="_blank">Symptom Assessment Scale (SAS)</a>| The Symptom Assessment Scale (SAS) describes the patientâ€™s level of distress relating to the seven most common symptoms by palliative patients. The SAS was developed in Australia (for details see [here](http://ahsri.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@chsd/@pcoc/documents/doc/uow129189.pdf)).
<a href="https://a3lfc.enketo.formhub.org/webform" target="_blank">'State your height' Survey</a>|A survey that shows some of OpenRosa's advanced features such as validation or branching. It was used in PROsaiq's initial demonstration (see [coming soon...](jroi.org)).


### II. View the HL7 message

The PROsaiq system generates a customised HL7 message from the ePRO data collected. In a live PROsaiq system this message is automtically imported into MOSAIQ after submission of ePRO instrument (browser or app) without any further user input. Thus providing the clinician a MOSIAQ-integrated longitudinal view of the ePRO data, without introducing time consuming steps such as switching to a different system (see ![example screenshot](images/screenhots/mosaiq-state_your_height.png) of 'State your height' data in MOSIAQ).  

The follwing steps are exclusive to the demonstrator (as explained in the preceeding paragraph):

* Browse to the HL7 Converter component  
  * [http://prosaiq-demo.herokuapp.com/odkSubmission/list](http://prosaiq-demo.herokuapp.com/odkSubmission/list)
  * please consider the CAVEAT below
* Find your submission
  * please note there might be multiple pages and the submission time is in [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)
  * in most cases your submission is the last one on the last page
* Click 'Generate HL7 message'
  * displays the HL7 message generated from the data collected before

> __CAVEAT__  
> For this demo the HL7 converter has been hosted as a web app on a freely available [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) server in the US. As a free-of-charge service the performance is limited. __When the app had been idle for more than 30min, it can take up to 60s until it can be reached (please refresh after about 1min).__ The reason for this delay is that the server is dynamically powered off/on in order to conserve energy and performance. 

### III. Data collection via Android app (OPTIONAL)

The app [ODK Collect](http://opendatakit.org/use/collect/) provides PROsaiq with an alterantive data collection method for smart devices running the Android operating system.  

While both methods have their strenghts (see [comparison matrix](https://enketo.org/openrosa)), the ODK Collect data collection variant is __optional__ in this demonstrator as it requires more prepration such as app download and configuration. The following instructions provide step-by-step instructions __(NEEDS UPDATING!)__:

* Install ODK Collect
  * follow the installation instructions at [http://opendatakit.org/use/collect/](http://opendatakit.org/use/collect/)
  * Version 1.4 (1038) was used at the time of writing these notes
* Configure the ODK Collect preferences
  * access the preferences by pressing the menu button in the ODK Collect start screen and clicking on 'General  Settings'
  * set Server Platform to 'Other'
  * set URL to 'https://formhub.org/tealow' __(NEEDS UPDATE)__
  * leave all other settings at default (User and Password can be blank)
* Download the the desired form 
  * click on 'Get Blank Form' button in ODK Collect's main menu
  * select and download the desired form (PRFS, SAS or 'State your height')
* Fill out the the desired form
  * click on 'Fill Blank Form' button in ODK Collect's main menu
  * select one of the forms downloaded in the previous step
  * fill it in by swiping through and following the prompts
  * once at the end of the form leave the 'finalised' checked and click the 'Save Form and Exit' (this step is not necessary if automated via 'General Settings')
* Send the the finalised form to the server (this step is not necessary if automated via 'General Settings')
  * click on 'Send Finalised Form' button
  * select and upload the filled in form (a success message confirms that the upload worked)
* View the HL7 message as per instructions [above](#ViewHL7)
